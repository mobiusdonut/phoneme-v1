# Phoneme ðŸ”Š
a redesigned version of the [IHS Voice website](ihsvoice.com) using React and Firebase!
use as a template for your own news sites.
created by [mobiusdonut](https://github.com/mobiusdonut). released under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

This repository is now outdated! I switched from a serverless implementation using React to one using server-side rendering to make it easier to implement social media meta tags and to allow for web crawlers to navigate the site. All the code contained here is still functional; just outmoded. Access the new repository [here](https://github.com/mobiusdonut/phoneme).

## Setup
Clone this repository, and download + extract the files.
Create and set up a [Firebase](firebase.google.com/) project with Authentication, Cloud Firestore, Storage, and Hosting.
Using the Firebase CLI, run `firebase login` and `firebase init` to initialize a new project in the directory. Select the new project when asked.
Copy and paste the Firebase SDK snippet into `/src/firebase.js`. It should look like this (sensitive info replaced with ########).
```
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "########",
  authDomain: "ihsvoice-f70bd.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://ihsvoice-f70bd.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "ihsvoice-f70bd",
  storageBucket: "ihsvoice-f70bd.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "########",
  appId: "########",
  measurementId: "########"
};
```
### Firebase
In Cloud Firestore, create the following collections:
```
firestore
â””â”€â”€â”€articles
â””â”€â”€â”€drafts
â””â”€â”€â”€homepage-grid
â””â”€â”€â”€users
```
In Storage, create the following folders:
```
storage
â””â”€â”€â”€article-photos
â””â”€â”€â”€staff-profiles
```
In the users collection, add a document with the following info:
```
â””â”€â”€â”€id (i set this to first initial + last name)
â”‚   â”‚   bio (a short description about you)
â”‚   â”‚   email (this is what you'll use to log in)
â”‚   â”‚   id (again)
â”‚   â”‚   image (a link to a photo of you hosted in the staff-profiles folder of storage)
â”‚   â”‚   name (kimi no na wa)
â”‚   â”‚   position (set this to Editor if you're admin, Staff-Writer otherwise)
â”‚   â”‚   years (in the format 19-20, 20-21, etc.)
```
For both Cloud Firestore and Storage, set read permissions to true, and write permissions to with authentication.
Go to Authentication and add a user using the email you provided. If you want to let more people publish articles, do the same thing but with different names, emails, etc.
### React
Modify the code in `src/App.js` and `src/index.css` however you want. If you're using this for your own site, remove the references to Irvington High and the IHS Voice (unless you want to give us free publicity).
Run `npm install` to install Suneditor, React Router, and React Helmet.
Run `npm build` to build the project, and `firebase deploy` to deploy it.
Happy posting~
